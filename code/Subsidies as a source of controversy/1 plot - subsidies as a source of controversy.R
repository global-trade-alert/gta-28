##GTA 28, Chapter: Global assessment on resort to subsidies
#Request SE: 
# Go to https://data.imf.org/?sk=3C005430-5FDC-4A07-9474-64D64F1FB3DC. 
# Extract information for each G20 government (SE:Please build the data up from the EU member state level. In general, this IMF database is not great but it is the only one I know that tries to track government subsidies.) 
# on the total value of subsidies paid (note that there is the option to extract subsidies paid by central and non-central governments , SE:pick both, where available. Again, it varies across countries. ). 
# Where possible, extract subsidies paid to public corporations and private firms and not subsidies paid to other levels of government or to individuals. 
# Data availability will vary across countries (please make a note of any major concerns in this regard). Collect data for years 2000 to 2020 (or 2019 if that is the last year available). 
# Convert amounts in local currencies into USD using the nominal exchange rate(JF: Take average annual exchange rate as supplied by IMF or WB. Create help file CSV if you canâ€™t pull it from an R library.)  for the year in question. 
# Produce a chart over time showing US, Chinese, EU (SE:Please include the UK throughout as in the EU. For almost all of the period of study the UK was a member of the EU.)   and rest of G20 subsidies as a stacked bar chart. Alternatively, produce the same chart as a line graph. 
# We can choose which chart one looks best.
